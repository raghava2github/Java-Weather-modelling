Weather Modeling Application

A lightweight Java Swing application that simulates weather modeling by generating random weather data for various locations. The user interface consists of a dropdown menu for location selection,
a title, and a results section that dynamically updates with the following details:

Temperature: Randomly generated between 10°C and 35°C.
Humidity: Randomly generated between 30% and 100%.
Precipitation: Randomly set as "Yes" or "No."
The application uses an ActionListener to handle user input and updates the display in real-time. It features a straightforward design, absolute layout positioning (setBounds), and intuitive random 
data generation, making it ideal for beginners exploring Java GUI programming concepts such as event handling and user interaction.

This project demonstrates the basics of creating interactive Java desktop applications with practical functionality.
